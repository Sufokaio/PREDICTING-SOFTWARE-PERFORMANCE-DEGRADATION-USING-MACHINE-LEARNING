This package uses the Tailor framework: https://github.com/jun-zeng/Tailor/tree/main

Some functions have been renamed to avoid context confusion (e.g. code clone -> performance degradation).
We do not claim that Tailor is our work, in fact we only made a couple of modifications. 

This package also uses data from the Code4Bench dataset: https://github.com/code4bench/Code4Bench 
The Java submissions used and the scripts that prepare the data are in this package. TODO: which files and where

Results in cpgnn/log

TODO: STeps to reproduce
